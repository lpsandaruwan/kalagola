# KalaGola - කාලගෝල

KalaGola is here to help you to traverse and track every single commit you have 
made on a typeface and give you a video file to see the beauty of it.

##### Requirements
You might need to install openCV centric libraries to get KalaGola serving. 
Please not that Kalagola is written and tested using Python 3 only.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Run KalaGola
Simply run `python3 kalagola.py -h` to get help. Or just edit the config
.yaml file as you want and just run `python3 kalagola.py`. If you provide 
arguments while calling the KalaGola, it will simply override the default 
settings.

##### Releases
KalaGola will release the binaries for Mac, Linux, Windows ASAP.
